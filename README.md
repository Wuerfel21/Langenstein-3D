# Langenstein 3D

### WTF is this?
Langenstein 3D is a retro-style FPS game, written in Java. It is supposed to look, sound and play like a game from the early 90's. That means 256-color pseudo 3D graphics, MIDI Metal soundtrack, health pickups, secrets, labyrinth-like levels, 2D sprites as enemies/objects and more.

### How the hell do i build this?
Just clone this repo into a Eclipse Workspace of your choice (make sure you call the project "Langenstein 3D", NOT "Langenstein-3D"!!!!), and hit Run!
You can also export to a jar, but this is usually unnecessary.

### Oh wise master, how shall I contribute?
Currently, contributions are not required/wanted, but they will when the game is in a vaguely playable state.

### Who made that cool music?
